# hello-world
This is my very first GitHub repository.
My name is Frank. I am from Zambia and particuly from the Copperbelt  Province. I have interest in software development because the low levels of appreciation of technology among my fellow citizen. I joined GitHub in order to learn coding and be able to develop softwares that can greatly contribute to locally sourced solutions to my country's technological needs.
